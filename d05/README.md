#Growler

##THE GOAL
- Twitter may be dominant today, but let's start working on the next big thing. You're going to make a micro blogging application called **GROWLER** using **Sinatra**. All the cool things we've covered this week will be put to use!

- **User stories:**
  - The user can write growls (micro blogs) of 142 characters maximum
  - The user can see all the growls that have been written 

##Review

- Ruby
  - Classes and objects
  - Gems
- Sinatra
  - Routes
  - Parameters
  - Sessions

##PHASES

###PHASE 1 - NO COMPUTERS
- **Pseudo Code** and break it down into small steps
  - Think about how you will write, access, and persist the growl data (**HINT** Think back to sessions this week)
  - Divide the different actions of your application into `get` and `post` requests and think about the paths you will create
  - Take time to answer these questions:
    - How will a user write a growl?
    - How will we display the growls onto the page?
    - Think about the validations you may need
  - Include some wireframes if you feel good!

###PHASE 2 - SET UP A GIT REPO
- Using GitHub, set up a public repository and add your partner as a collaborator 
- **TIP** Remember to check the box for initializing a README file so that a ```master``` branch is automatically created for you
- Remember to push your commits so that your partner can pull the code down when it's their turn to program

###PHASE 3 - PAIR PROGRAMMING
- Time to set up some `get` routes!
- You will need paths to: 
  - Show all the growls
  - A page with a form to create new growls
- How will you take the user from one page to the other?
- Move on to the `post` routes
  - How will the user create growls?
  - How will you persist that information?
  - What view will the user see once their growl is saved? (How will they get there?)

###PHASE 4 - SET UP THE LOOK
- Set up a `public` folder to store your CSS and images
- Set up and build your views in a `views` folder
- Write the base HTML you'll need with some mock data, we'll worry about making it dynamic in the next steps
- Write the CSS to apply some basic styles

**TIP** Don't spend too much time on this step! Get some basic styles onto the page - you'll probably need time to go back and fix or amend your Ruby logic after you've added the views.
  
###PHASE 5
- Show your creations!
- Things you will cover:
  - Demo
  - Show some code
  - What did you struggle with / How did you solve it?
  - Things to do differently
- **Every one has to talk**


- **BONUSes**
  - Add tagging functionality 
  - Add commenting functionality
  - Add a user profile page that will show only the user's growls. How will you differentiate between users?
  - Allow people to go to a single growl's page
